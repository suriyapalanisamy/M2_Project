### Some of the features of the project 

You may save a user's name, examine their highest score, and even reset their score in this quiz game mini project. Additionally, the game is separated into two rounds to make it more engaging; the player must pass the first round before moving on to the second. 

The first of the two rounds I described is known as the Warm-up Round, and the second is known as the Challenge Round. The user is offered three straightforward questions in the warm-up round, and they must successfully answer at least two of them to advance to the following round. If the user is unable of doing so, he will not be allowed to continue. 

### Defining Our System 

The user will be asked questions incessantly in the second and more fascinating round of this quiz game in C, and for each correct answer supplied, they will be awarded $100,000! 

When the user's monetary award reaches $1 million, the game is over. There are four alternatives for each question: A, B, C, and D. Because there are no negative indications, the user's accrued cash money will not be removed for incorrect responses.
